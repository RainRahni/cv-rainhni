      <p>
        Hi, I'm Rain RÃ¤hni, a 2nd-year Bachelor's student in Informatics/Computer Science at Tallinn University of
        Technology. I've honed my skills in Backend Development using Java and Spring Boot through several school
        and personal projects. I also have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js. I'm particularly drawn
        to backend development with Java. I am eager to deepen my understanding and contribute to innovative solutions
        in these fields.
      </p>

        As an IT student, I aspire to impact the world positively through technological developments, whether initiated by me or others. In the future, I aim to own a company
        that helps people's lifes.Beyond my technical skills, I bring communication to my work. I'm also an active
        football player and enjoy spending time with friends.
